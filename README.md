# Project documentation for a Django Girls tutorial blog

## Introduction
The blog project was created using the Django framework, SQLite database, and deployed on pythonanywhere.com at https://marekdrag.pythonanywhere.com/. The aim of the project was to learn the basics of programming in Django and create a functional blog with the ability to add posts, comments, and edit/delete them by the administrator.

## Application Description
The project consists of two applications: blog and accounts. The blog application implements the functionality of adding posts and comments. Users can browse posts and add comments, but only logged-in users can add posts. The administrator can edit and delete posts and comments. The accounts application allows users to log in and register on the website.
